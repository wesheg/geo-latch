Second Proposal Plan:

First Stop:
Love Circle
Inside the box are notes from the first few months of dating, two blank pieces of paper, two envelopes, and two pens. Read the notes together, and then each person writes a letter to the other which will be sealed until next year. Wait 12 months and read each other's
letter.


Second Stop:
Centennial Park, near the pond
Inside the box are pieces of magician's flash paper, folded into boats with a wick.
On the sails of the boats are written words like "Shame", "Hiding", "Self-Righteousness",
etc. Give those emotions a proper Viking funeral! Set them out to sea in a burning ship.
Play dramatic Anglo Saxon music on Spotify.


Third Stop:
PM
Inside the box is cash. Lunch Time!


Fourth Stop:
Barnes & Noble in Cool Springs
Box contains a riddle which leads to the book "What Do You Do With A Chance?"
by Kobi Yamada. Read the book together and take a copy home.


Last Stop:
Home
Inside the box is the "La Vie En Rose" Music Box and an Enso Ring.
