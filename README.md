# Geo-Latch 🌎🔓

Arduino-based project I built when I had some free time during COVID lockdown.
The `geo_latch.ino` file is an Arduino sketch that powered the locking mechanism
of a homemade wooden box.

The box would lock from the inside, and would only open if you were standing
within a 25-yard radius of a specific GPS coordinate.
